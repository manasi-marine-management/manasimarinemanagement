             &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The opportunity to travel around the world and the lure of adventure on the high seas, besides the possibility of high remunerations attracts many youngsters to make a career in the Merchant Navy. Merchant Navy is different from the navy in the sense that it offers commercial services, as opposed to the navy, which is largely involved in the defence of a nation.
    Merchant Navy is the backbone of international trade, carrying cargo all over the world. The merchant ships employ a huge number of workers to carry and deliver goods from one country to another. Without the merchant navy, much of the import-export business would come to a grinding halt!<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A career in the merchant navy is considered a glamorous job, especially by the people who have been bitten by the travel bug. It offers an opportunity to visit new and exotic places all around the globe. Merchant Navy career is not only monetarily rewarding but also satisfying and a bit challenging.
    The Merchant navy career options mainly includes the following category :<br>
    •	Navigating officers (Deck side officers)<br>
    •	Marine engineering Officers (Engine side officers)<br>
    •	Crew members (To assist the officers)<br>
    •	Specialized officers (Electrical officer, Radio officers)
             </p>
